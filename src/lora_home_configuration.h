 * @brief Coding rate of the radio
 * LoRa modulation also adds a forward error correction (FEC) in every data transmission.

 * Using this redundancy will allow the LoRa signal to endure short interferences.
 * The Coding Rate (CR) value need to be adjusted according to conditions of the channel used for data transmission.
 * If there are too many interference in the channel, then itâ€™s recommended to increase the value of CR.
 * However, the rise in CR value will also increase the duration for the transmission
